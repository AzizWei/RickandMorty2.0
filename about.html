                        <h1>Rick Sanchez</h1>
                        <p>Rick is an elderly genius scientist, the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of Morty and Summer. His alcoholism concerns his daughter's family, particularly the safety of Morty. "Rick and Morty" primarily revolves around Rick's storyline. He often appears neurotic, yet he remains remarkably intelligent and values his time greatly. He disdains many things ordinary people care about but occasionally shows genuine affection for his grandchildren in the series. He believes he's superior to other family members but occasionally reveals his loneliness. During conversations, he frequently interrupts with burps, seemingly due to his drinking habits.</p>

                        <h1>Morty Smith</h1>
                        <p>Morty is Rick's 14-year-old grandson. He's kind-hearted, innocent, but easily discouraged. Rick often drags him on adventures, and he bears a strong resemblance to his father. Morty doesn't always follow Rick's plans, leading to trouble and Rick rescuing him. While not particularly bright and somewhat weak-willed, Morty occasionally displays bravery and resilience, often criticizing Rick's bizarre behavior. His frequent adventures with Rick result in high school absenteeism. Rick calls him "Mortiest Morty" due to his courage. In Season 1, Episode 10, Morty claims to be from Earth C-137 but leaves the mystery unresolved. Some characters mention his learning disability, though it's believed he suppresses his intelligence due to insecurity.</p>

                        <h1>Beth Smith</h1>
                        <p>Beth is Rick's daughter, Morty and Summer's mother, and Jerry's wife. She's a professional horse veterinarian who, despite enjoying her job, is dissatisfied with her marriage. After becoming the sole breadwinner post-Season 1, Episode 4, she originally aspired to be a human surgeon but became pregnant at 17. She's a dependable presence at home, displaying facets of selfishness, humor, and wisdom. She's also uneasy about Rick taking her son on adventures and causing trouble. When Rick, who was captured, returns home, Beth is forced to choose between her father and husband, ultimately choosing Rick, leading to her separation from Jerry.</p>

                        <h1>Jerry Smith</h1>
                        <p>Jerry is the father of Morty and Summer, husband to Beth, and Rick's son-in-law. He lacks confidence and often complains, being the most opposed to Rick's influence on the family. His career hasn't been successful; he used to work at a small advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Jerry frequently frets over problems and argues with Beth, but they share a codependent relationship. He's troubled by his perceived inadequacy and the state of his marriage, even battling insecurity. When Rick, who was captured, returns home, Jerry separates from Beth due to his dissatisfaction with Rick and moves into a motel, living on unemployment benefits. Towards the end of Season 3, Jerry reunites with Beth and the rest of the family.</p>

                        <h1>Summer Smith</h1>
                        <p>Summer is Morty's 17-year-old sister. She's a traditionally-minded teenager who often strives to improve her standing among peers. Summer shares some similarities with her mother and can come across as very smart and humorous. Occasionally, she feels jealous of Morty's adventures with Rick. In the episode "Get Schwifty," she's the only family member who wants to save Rick, despite her brother initially thinking Rick is just a selfish jerk. When her parents agree to divorce, Summer harbors resentment toward her father and reveals her darker side until reconciling with Jerry.</p>
